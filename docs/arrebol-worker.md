# Setting up Arrebol worker

The Worker is component is responsible to execute the tasks of SAPS workflow in cooperation with the Arrebol execution service. The output generated by the Worker is shared with the Archiver through a NFS file system. To configure the Worker and the NFS, follow the steps below in the Worker VM .

## Docker

To configure Docker, follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/wesleymonte/worker-deployment). When they are successfully completed, proceed to the instructions below).

## NFS Client

To configure the NFS client, access the worker VM and follow the steps below.

### Dependencies

In an apt-based Linux distribution, enter the commands below to install NFS client with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
```

### Configure

It is necessary to mount the NFS storage on the host for the purpose of SAPS operation, to do this, use the name of the root folder `/nfs` **(there should not be another name for this folder)** for the mapping occurring, being done as follows:

```
sudo mkdir -p /nfs
sudo mount -t nfs <nfs-temp-storage-ip>:<nfs-temp-storage-path> /nfs
```

Where:
- **nfs-temp-storage-ip** is the IP of the VM that contains the NFS temp storage
- **nfs-temp-storage-path** is the same path used by SAPS for NFS temp storage as mentioned [here](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-engine/blob/develop/docs/archiver-install.md#temporary-storage)

### Test

Go to the VM that is NFS temp storage and run the following command:
```bash
touch <path-nfs-temp-storage>/test
```

Then, go to the worker VM and run this:
```
ls /nfs
```

If the empty file `test` was viewed by the worker, the sharing was successful.
