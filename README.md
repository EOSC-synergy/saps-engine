## What is SEBAL-scheduler?
SEBAL-scheduler is a tool for running the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in a federated cloud environment managed by the [Fogbow Middleware](https://www.google.com). SEBAL-scheduler abstracts away a complex distributed infra-structure and allows the user to focus on the application requirements.
